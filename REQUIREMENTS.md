# Recipe Management Application

## Objective

Create a standalone Java application that allows users to manage their favorite recipes. The application should provide functionality for adding, updating, removing, and fetching recipes. Users should also be able to filter available recipes based on specific criteria:

1. Whether or not the dish is vegetarian
2. The number of servings
3. Specific ingredients (either include or exclude)
4. Text search within the instructions

For example, the API should be able to handle the following search requests:

- All vegetarian recipes
- Recipes that can serve 4 persons and have “potatoes” as an ingredient
- Recipes without “salmon” as an ingredient that has “oven” in the instructions.

## Requirements

Please ensure that there is documentation about the architectural choices and instructions on how to run the application. The project should be delivered as a GitHub (or any other public git hosting) repository URL.

All the following requirements must be satisfied:

1. It must be a REST application implemented using Java (use a framework of your choice).
2. The code should be production-ready.
3. The REST API must be documented.
4. Data must be persisted in a database.
5. Unit tests must be present.
6. Integration tests must be present.

## Documentation

Include documentation in the repository covering:

- Architectural choices
- How to run the application

## Submission

Provide the project as a GitHub (or any other public git hosting) repository URL.
